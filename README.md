# Image_Analysis
A python script was written to process each image file. As the purpose here is to illustrate process and not particularly the application of rigorous image analysis science, the attributes analyzed will be the dominant color and the five color palette it is comprised of. Used was a method of vector quantization; k-means clustering to calculate these attributes.
